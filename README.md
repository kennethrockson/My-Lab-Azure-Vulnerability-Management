I will share my experience of creating an Azure Vulnerability Management Lab. I will also discuss what I found good about the lab and how it has helped me to improve my vulnerability management practices.

Creating the Lab

The first step in creating the lab was to choose the right tools. I decided to use one vulnerability assessment tool: OpenVAS. This tools was free to use for evaluation purposes. Once I had chosen the tool, I created a new Azure subscription and provisioned a virtual machine. I then installed the tools on the virtual machines and configured them to scan my production environment.

Scanning the Environment

Once I connected my remote desktop client with Remmina and tools were configured, I ran a scan of my production environment. The scans took several minutes to complete, but they were worth the wait. The scans identified a number of unique results,vulnerabilities in my environment, including outdated software, misconfigured security settings, and open ports.

Remediating the Vulnerabilities

Once the vulnerabilities were identified, I began the process of remediating them. This involved applying security patches, configuring security settings correctly, and closing open ports.

The remediation process took several more minutes to complete, but it was necessary to ensure that my environment was secure. I am confident that the vulnerabilities that were identified in the scan have been remediated. Check out more of the results below!

What I Found Good About the Lab

I found a number of things good about the Azure Vulnerability Management Lab. First, the lab allowed me to test and evaluate different vulnerability assessment tools. This helped me to choose the right tools for my environment.

Second, the lab allowed me to scan my production environment for vulnerabilities. This helped me to identify and remediate vulnerabilities that I would not have otherwise known about.

Third, the lab allowed me to learn about vulnerability management best practices. This knowledge will help me to improve my vulnerability management practices in the future.

Conclusion

I am glad that I created an Azure Vulnerability Management Lab. The lab has helped me to improve my vulnerability management practices and protect my environment from attack. If you are looking for a way to improve your vulnerability management practices, I recommend creating an Azure Vulnerability Management Lab. It is a valuable tool that can help you to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your environment.

Tips for Creating a Vulnerability Management Lab

Here are some tips for creating a vulnerability management lab:

Use a variety of vulnerability assessment tools. This will help you to get a more comprehensive view of your environment's vulnerabilities.

Scan your virtual machines regularly. This will help you to identify and remediate vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

Automate your vulnerability management process. This will save you time and effort.

Monitor your environment for new vulnerabilities. This will help you to stay ahead of attackers.

I hope these tips help you to create a successful Azure Vulnerability Management Lab!
